<H1>Design Inspired Bar and Counter Stools by Bar Stool Gems </H1>

<H2>Bar Stool Gems is proudly Canadian owned and operated </H2>
We founded our online shop after going from store to store looking for those special furniture pieces. Itâ€™s a tiring process, not to mention a cold one in the long winters here in Canada.
The idea behind our store was simple: create a one stop online shopping experience with quality, on-trend furniture that is shipped free across Canada.
 
<H2>We started with Counter Stools</H2>
We think counter stools are one of the most important statement pieces in
any home. They provide additional seating and can make or break the look of
your kitchen or bar. We have a great selection with all sorts styles, finishes
& colours and challenge you to not find one that fits your decor perfectly!
 
<H2>We also specialize in bar height stools</H2>
For those who want a stool with a little extra height, we've got bar height stools that are perfect for any home bar or kitchen island.
Our bar stools are made with a focus on design and craftmanship, so you can be sure to find the perfect match for your home bar or business need.
 
<H2>Our bar stool chairs are quality tested (and all other furniture pieces too ðŸ˜Š)</H2>
Our pieces go through rigorous quality checks for residential use and many for commercial use too. Each product description details if theyâ€™ll work in a business setting so you can rest assure that youâ€™re approving the right, quality furniture piece to make your office or restaurant space feel individual, luxurious and even more comfy and cosy.
